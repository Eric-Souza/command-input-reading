# Text Reading Algorithm  

Receives a text file as input by a makefile command and prints its data line by line using string stream.
 
* Compile the code by running the command below on the Makefile directory:  

```{bash}  
make  
```  

* The "make" command will create the "run.out" file in the "bin" folder, which can be used to execute the app. To print the chosen input text data, run the command below in the "bin" folder:  

```{bash}  
run.out ../inputs/text-file-name.txt  
```
